# rollDiceGame

<h2>My first game</h2>
<h3>This project is my first game which i built in JS</h3>
<p>My levels process were:</p>
<ul>
<li>write the HTML</li>
<li>Add the css</li>
<li>Make it functionally with JS-only with two operants</li>
<li>Than i add sound effects, counter of wins and more features</li>
<li>My last big level was a challenge- to add AI operant</li>
<li>Finally i improved the design and made my code to be more closed </li>
</ul>
